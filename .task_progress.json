THE System SHALL allow the User to add an unlimited number of statements to a single quiz\n3. WHEN the User enters a statement, THE System SHALL require the User to designate the correct answer as either \"True\" or \"False\" before saving\n4. THE System SHALL provide edit and delete functionality for each statement after it has been added\n5. IF a statement field is left empty, THEN THE System SHALL display a validation error and prevent the statement from being saved\n\n### Requirement 2: Question Order Randomization\n\n**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to randomize the order of questions, so that I can create multiple versions of the same quiz to prevent cheating.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the User selects the \"Randomize Questions\" option, THE System SHALL shuffle the order of all statements randomly\n2. THE System SHALL maintain the correct answer association with each statement during randomization\n3. WHEN the User generates multiple randomized versions, THE System SHALL create a unique question order for each version\n4. THE System SHALL provide a preview of the randomized order before finalizing the quiz\n5. IF the User chooses not to randomize, THEN THE System SHALL maintain the original order in which statements were entered\n\n### Requirement 3: Answer Key Generation\n\n**User Story:** As a tutor, I want the system to automatically generate a separate answer key, so that I can quickly grade student quizzes without manually tracking correct answers.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the User generates a quiz, THE System SHALL automatically create a corresponding answer key with all correct answers\n2. THE System SHALL display the answer key on a separate page or document from the quiz\n3. THE System SHALL number each answer in the answer key to match the corresponding question number in the quiz\n4. IF the quiz has been randomized, THEN THE System SHALL generate an answer key that matches the specific randomized version\n5. THE System SHALL clearly label the document as \"Answer Key\" to distinguish it from the student quiz\n\n### Requirement 4: Quiz Customization\n\n**User Story:** As a homeschool parent, I want to customize the quiz title, instructions, and student name field, so that I can personalize quizzes for my children and specific learning objectives.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. THE System SHALL provide input fields for customizing the quiz title, instructions, and student name field label\n2. WHEN the User enters a custom quiz title, THE System SHALL display it prominently at the top of the generated quiz\n3. WHEN the User enters custom instructions, THE System SHALL display them below the title and above the first question\n4. IF the User enables the student name field, THEN THE System SHALL include a labeled blank line at the top of the quiz for student identification\n5. THE System SHALL save customization settings and apply them to the generated quiz and answer key\n\n### Requirement 5: PDF Export Functionality\n\n**User Story:** As a corporate trainer, I want to export quizzes as PDF files, so that I can easily distribute them digitally or print them for training sessions.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.

THE System SHALL create a separate PDF file for the answer key when requested\n3. THE System SHALL format the PDF with appropriate margins, font sizes, and spacing for professional appearance\n4. WHEN the PDF is generated, THE System SHALL prompt the User to download or save the file\n5. THE System SHALL preserve all customizations (title, instructions, student name field) in the exported PDF\n\n### Requirement 6: Direct Print Functionality\n\n**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to print quizzes directly from the browser, so that I can quickly produce paper copies without additional steps.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the User clicks the \"Print\" button, THE System SHALL open the browser's print dialog with the quiz formatted for printing\n2. THE System SHALL apply print-optimized formatting including page breaks, margins, and font sizing\n3. THE System SHALL provide separate print options for the quiz and answer key\n4. WHILE the print preview is displayed, THE System SHALL show how the quiz will appear on printed pages\n5. IF the quiz spans multiple pages, THEN THE System SHALL ensure questions are not split awkwardly across page breaks\n\n### Requirement 7: Statement Input Validation\n\n**User Story:** As a student creating study materials, I want the system to validate my inputs, so that I can ensure my quiz is complete and error-free before generating it.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the User attempts to generate a quiz, THE System SHALL verify that at least one statement has been added\n2. IF any statement lacks a designated correct answer, THEN THE System SHALL display an error message and prevent quiz generation\n3. THE System SHALL check for duplicate statements and warn the User if identical statements are detected\n4. WHEN the User enters a statement exceeding 500 characters, THE System SHALL display a warning about readability\n5. IF required customization fields (such as quiz title) are empty, THEN THE System SHALL either use default values or prompt the User to complete them\n\n### Requirement 8: Quiz Preview\n\n**User Story:** As a tutor, I want to preview the quiz before printing or exporting, so that I can verify formatting and content accuracy.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.

  "design": "# Design Document: True or False Quiz Generator\n\n## Overview\n\nThe True or False Quiz Generator is a client-side web application built with React that enables educators and trainers to create, customize, and export printable true/false quizzes. The application provides a streamlined interface for statement management, quiz customization, randomization capabilities, and professional export options (PDF and direct printing). All data is persisted locally in the browser's localStorage to prevent data loss during sessions.\n\nThe system architecture follows a component-based design pattern with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data persistence layers. The application operates entirely in the browser without requiring backend services, making it fast, secure, and accessible offline after initial load.\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Component Architecture Diagram",
